## Translated documents in other languages
Provide more users with convenient and fast operation aids in more languages. This folder is only available for users to view document translations, not to provide program translation files, all program translation files are displayed on the home page of the repository.

Everyone is welcome to participate in the supplementary translation of the document. Since we update the documentation frequently, please refer to the original (Chinese Simplified version) for the standard version.

## Documentation centers for other languages

## You translate with documents
Before you officially translate a document, we want you to be good at using the translator and the tools you already have. Learn what features and documentation mean. If you wish, please pull the branch to commit to us when you're done.

## About translation packs
You can create a translation package for the program as much as you want. We also very much support you in making translation packages for this program, and it would be nice if they could be made public.

However, when translating, we strongly recommend that you try to look at the relevant documentation first to improve the quality of your translation.
